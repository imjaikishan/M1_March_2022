# About this project 
1. It is used to manage your gym members data 
2. You can simply use this program by entering the password 
3. the password for this program is :- 'pass'

## Some points to be kept in mind 
1. It is basically programmed in windows and I have used some windows specific header files which includes :- 
   - "windows.h" --> you can read about it ðŸ”—-https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-language/?view=msvc-170
   - "dos.h" --> learn about it here ðŸ”—-https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dos-h-header-in-c-with-examples/
    
2. If you're on linux system and you try to compile and run this code it will be prone to errors as <br> 
   - In linux we don't use windows.h the alternative for that is  ***#include <GL/gl.h>, #include <GL/glu.h>, #include <GL/glx.h>***
   - these are the basic GUI header files if you want to replace **"windows.h"**
